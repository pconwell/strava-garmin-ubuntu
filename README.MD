## Overview

## How to use this script

### Set up API Token
The script itself is fairly easy. The hardest part is setting up correct access to the Strava API.

1. Go to https://developers.strava.com/ and create an app
2. It doesn't matter what you enter into the fields EXCEPT the Authorization Callback Domain *must* be `localhost:8000`
3. The only things you will need is the 'Client ID' and the 'Client Secret'
4. 



Once you have your access token, the hard part is over.
